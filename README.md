|What | Notes|score 0..4<br>(0=no, 2=ok, 4=wow!)|
|-----|------|------|
|Misc | Group members attended tutorial sessions||
|Distrbuted dev model: | decisions made by unanmyous vote}
|| group meetings had a round robin speaking order|
|| group meetings had a moderator that managed the round robin|
|| group meeting moderator rotated among  the group|
|| code conforms to some packaging standard|
|| code has can be downloaded from some standard package manager|
| |workload is spread over the whole team (one team member is often Xtimes more productive than the others... but nevertheless, here is a track record that everyone is contributing a lot)||
|| Number of commits||
|| Number of commits: by different people||
|| Issues reports: there are many||
||  issues are being  closed||
|| License: exists||
|| DOI badge: exists ||
||Docs: doco generated , format not ugly ||
||Docs: what: point descriptions of each class/function (in isolation) ||
||Docs: how: for common use cases X,Y,Z mini-tutorials showing worked examples on how to do X,Y,Z||
||Docs: why: docs tell a story, motivate the whole thing, deliver a punchline that makes you want to rush out and use the thing||
||Docs: 3 minute video, posted to YouTube. That convinces people why they want to work on your code.||
|| (hard) code conforms to some known patterns |

|Tools Matter| Use of version control tools||
|| Extensive use of version control tools ||
|| Repo has an up-to-date requirements.txt file||
|| Repo does not have "ignore" files.||
||Use of  style checkers ||
||Extensive Use of  style checkers ||
|| Use of code  formatters. ||
|| Extensive Use of code  formatters. ||
|| Use of syntax checkers. ||
|| Extensive use of syntax checkers. ||
|| Use of code coverage ||
|| Extensive use of code coverage ||
|| other automated analysis tools||
|| Extensive use of  other automated analysis tools||
|| test cases exist||
|| test cases are routinely executed||

| Consensus-oriented model| the files CONTRIBUTING.md and CODEOFCONDUCT.md has have multiple edits by multiple people||
| | the files CONTRIBUTING.md lists coding standards and lots of tips on how to extend the system without screwing things up||
| | multiple people contribute to discussions||
|| issues are discussed before they are closed||
|| Chat channel: exists||
|| Chat channel: is active ||
|| test cases:.a large proportion of the issues related to handling failing cases.||
| Zero internal boundaries | evidence that the whole team is using the same tools: everyone can get to all tools and files||
| | evidence that the whole team is using the same tools (e.g. config files in the repo, updated by lots of different people)||
| | evidence that the whole team is using the same tools (e.g. tutor can ask anyone to share screen, they demonstrate the system running on their computer)||
| | evidence that the members of the team are working across multiple places in the code base||
| Low-regressions rule | (hard to judge) features released are not subsequently removed||
|Short release cycles | (hard to see in short projects) project members are committing often enough so that everyone can get your work||
